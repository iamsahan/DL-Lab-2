QUESTION - 01

Low hidden nodes - Underfitting
  The model has low capacity to learn patterns.
  Decision boundary is too simple.
  Accuracy is low because the network cannot capture the complexity of the dataset.

Moderate hidden nodes - Better accuracy
  The model can represent non-linear relationships.
  Decision boundaries become more flexible.
  Accuracy increases as the network fits the data better.

Too many hidden nodes - Risk of Overfitting
  The model becomes too powerful and starts memorizing training data instead of generalizing.
  Training accuracy may look very high, but test accuracy could drop.
  Computation time also increases unnecessarily.


QUESTION - 02

Increases as hidden nodes increase at first.Plateaus after a certain point. May decrease slightly if overfitting happens.
